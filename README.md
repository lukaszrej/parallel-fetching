# Parallel fetching in React

A simple application demonstrating an interesting concept of data fetching in React.js. Inspired by [this blog post](https://www.developerway.com/posts/how-to-fetch-data-in-react). <br />Also my training in using some cool features like `generics`, `interfaces`, `custom types`, `data providers` and more.

## Tech-stack

- [React (v.18.2)](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## Demo
